# Air Quality Index (AQI) Project

This project aims to provide real-time information on air quality based on the Air Quality Index (AQI). It uses data from various environmental monitoring stations to evaluate air quality and provide relevant insights to users. The goal of this project is to help users understand air quality conditions in their area and take necessary precautions when the air quality is poor.

## Features
- **Real-Time AQI Data**: The system fetches the latest AQI data for various cities or specific geographic locations.
- **Interactive Visualization**: The data is presented in an easy-to-understand graphical format, showing trends over time and comparisons between different locations.
- **Health Recommendations**: Based on the AQI levels, the system provides health advisories for sensitive groups (e.g., children, elderly, and individuals with respiratory conditions).
- **Location-based Alerts**: Users can receive notifications about high or low air quality levels in their chosen area.
